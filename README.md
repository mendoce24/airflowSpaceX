# SpaceX - Airflow Pipeline

A solo project as part of the **Platzi** Training in Airflow

## Project description

Platzi's marketing and analyst teams need data from
students who have accessed the satellite and information on the history of
SpaceX events, therefore we need you to help us execute the
following tasks.
1. Wait for NASA to give us authorization to access the data
of the satellite.
2. Collect data from the satellite and leave it in a file.
3. Collect data from the SpaceX API and leave it in a file.
4. Send a message to the computers that the final data is
available.



## Installation

1. Clone [airflowSpaceX](https://github.com/mendoce24/airflowSpaceX.git) repository
2. Change directory to the root of the repository
3. Install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. running the command `docker-compose.yaml` to create the docker container for Airflow.
